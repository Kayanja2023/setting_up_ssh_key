# ✅ GitHub SSH Key Setup — Documentation

This README documents the successful setup of an SSH connection between a local machine and GitHub for the user **Andile Michael Kayanja Lwanga (`Kayanja2023`)**.

---

## 📌 Objective
Establish a secure and password-less connection to GitHub using SSH, enabling streamlined cloning, pushing, and pulling from remote repositories.

---

## 🔐 SSH Key Generation

**Command used:**
```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "KayanjaLwanga@outlook.com"
```

- The key pair was saved to the default path:
  - Private key: `C:\Users\Dell\.ssh\id_ed25519`
  - Public key: `C:\Users\Dell\.ssh\id_ed25519.pub`
- A passphrase was added for enhanced security.

---

## 📋 Public Key Copied to Clipboard

**PowerShell Command:**
```powershell
Get-Content $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\id_ed25519.pub | Set-Clipboard
```

This ensured the **correct public key** was copied in OpenSSH format.

---

## 🌐 Key Added to GitHub

- Navigated to: [https://github.com/settings/keys](https://github.com/settings/keys)
- Clicked: **"New SSH key"**
- Title: `new_ssh`
- Pasted the public key into the Key field
- Clicked **"Add SSH key"**
- GitHub confirmed: **“You have successfully added the key.”**

---

## ✅ SSH Connection Verified

**Tested with:**
```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

**Result:**
```
Hi Kayanja2023! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```

---

## 📦 Cloning a Repository (Example)

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Kayanja2023/your-repo-name.git
```

Replace `your-repo-name` with the actual repository you wish to clone.

---

## 🧹 Cleanup / Missteps Resolved

- Accidentally attempted to upload a **private key** → Resolved by deleting old key pair and regenerating it correctly.
- Used **PowerShell instead of CMD** to run `Remove-Item` and clipboard commands properly.

---

## 🧠 Lessons Learned

- GitHub only accepts public keys in **OpenSSH format** (e.g., starting with `ssh-ed25519`).
- **Private keys must never be uploaded** or shared.
- PowerShell offers better support for Git-related operations on Windows than CMD.
